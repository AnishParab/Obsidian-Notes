# List Concatenation (`+`)

```python
base_liquid = ["water", "milk"]
extra_flavor = ["ginger"]

full_liquid_mix = base_liquid + extra_flavor
print(f"Liquid mix: {full_liquid_mix}")
```

**Output:**
```
Liquid mix: ['water', 'milk', 'ginger']
```

# Explanation

- The `+` operator merges two lists into one.
- This is an example of **operator overloading**, where `+` performs **concatenation** instead of arithmetic addition.
