> **NOTE**: Almost everything you write in comprehensions, can be solved using loops.
> **Comprehensions** is a production-stylized code.

> They are concise way of creating lists, sets, dictionaries or generators using a single line of code, although not easy to understand.

# Python Comprehensions
### Definition
Comprehensions provide a compact syntax for creating lists, sets, dictionaries, and generators in a single line of code.

---
### Common Use Cases
* **Filtering**: Select items that meet a condition.
* **Transformation**: Apply an operation to each item.
* **Collection Creation**: Build new collections based on existing data.
* **Flattening nested Structure**: Collapse nested iterables.

---
### Benefits
* Cleaner and more readable code.
* Potential speed and memory gains compared to manual loops.

# Types of Comprehensions
1. **List Comprehension** → `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`
2. **Set Comprehension** → `{expression for item in iterable if condition}`
3. **Dictionary Comprehension** → `{key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable if condition}`
4. **Generator Expression** → `(expression for item in iterable if condition)`
