# List Repetition (`*`)

```python
strong_brew = ["black tea", "water"] * 3
print(f"Strong brew: {strong_brew}")
```

**Output:**
```
Strong brew: ['black tea', 'water', 'black tea', 'water', 'black tea', 'water']
```

# Explanation

- The `*` operator repeats the list elements `n` times.
- Here, multiplying by `3` repeats the list three times.
