# What is Deep Learning: Basic Inroduction
- **Deep Learning** is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.
-  It is inspired by the structure of a **human brain**.
- Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure called **Neural Networks**.

# What Is Deep Learning ?
- It focuses on learning **complex representations** of data using **multi-layered neural networks**.
- Deep learning models learn patterns by **automatically discovering features** from raw data, rather than relying on manually engineered features.
- These models improve performance by **iteratively adjusting parameters** based on errors during training.

> Key idea:  
> **Deep learning is about learning representations, not just making predictions.**
