# History of Deep Learning
- 1960's - perceptron by give the scientists name
- He had strong views

- 1969 - The first AI winter
- Perceptron cannot learn an XOR function.

- 1980s - The rise (Joff Hilton)
- Learning Representations using Backpropagating errors.

- 1989 - zip codes, computer vision and CNN

- 90's - The second AI winter
- data was less and weights intialization was random and algorithms like random forest came.

- 2006 - Joff Hilton (Unsupervised Pre-training and Deep Belief Techniques)
- You can add as many layers as you want and hence pre-training.

- 2012 - the final rise
- Imagenet challenge
- Deep learning on top of GPU's
- Error rate was less.
- Google's deepmind
- GAN by Ian

- Labeled datasets increased.
- Better hardware.
- Sophisticated Algorithms can be used using tf and pytorch.
