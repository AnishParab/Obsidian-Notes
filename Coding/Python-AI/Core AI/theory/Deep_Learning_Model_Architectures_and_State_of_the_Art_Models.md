# Model Architecture Breakthroughs
Earlier:
- Designing architectures required **trial, error, time, and cost**

Now:
- **Transfer Learning** allows reuse of proven architectures
- Pretrained models achieve **state-of-the-art performance**

### Examples
- Image Classification → **ResNet**
- Text Understanding → **BERT**
- Image Segmentation → **U-Net**
- Image Translation → **pix2pix**
- Object Detection → **YOLO**
- Speech Generation → **WaveNet**

> Architecture reuse dramatically reduced development cost.
