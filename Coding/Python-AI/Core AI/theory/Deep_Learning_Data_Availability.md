# Data Availability
- Deep learning models are **data-hungry**
- Around **2010 onwards**:
    - Smartphones became widespread
    - Internet access became cheap and ubiquitous
    - Social media platforms exploded
- Result:
    - Massive generation of images, text, audio, and video
    - **Data generation grew exponentially with time**

> Without large datasets, deep learning fails to generalize.
