# What is Deep Learning: Basic Inroduction
- **Deep Learning** is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.
-  It is inspired by the structure of a **human brain**.
- Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure called **Neural Networks**.

---
# What Is Deep Learning ?
- It focuses on learning **complex representations** of data using **multi-layered neural networks**.
- Deep learning models learn patterns by **automatically discovering features** from raw data, rather than relying on manually engineered features.
- These models improve performance by **iteratively adjusting parameters** based on errors during training.

> Key idea:  
> **Deep learning is about learning representations, not just making predictions.**

# Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

### Machine Learning
- Relies primarily on **statistical and mathematical techniques**.
- Often requires **manual feature engineering**.
- Works well with **structured or smaller-scale data**.
- Examples: linear regression, decision trees, SVMs.

### Deep Learning
- Uses **neural networks with multiple hidden layers**.
- Learns features **automatically from data**.
- Excels at **high-dimensional and unstructured data** (images, audio, text).
- Requires **large datasets and higher computational power**.
- Examples: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers.

# Core Distinction (Important)
- **Machine Learning** answers:  
    _“Given these features, how do I make a prediction?”_
- **Deep Learning** answers:  
    _“What features should I learn in order to make the prediction?”_

# One-Line Summary

> **Machine Learning depends on features you design.  
> Deep Learning depends on representations the model learns.**
