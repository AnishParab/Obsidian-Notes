# Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
### Machine Learning
- Relies primarily on **statistical and mathematical techniques**.
- Often requires **manual feature engineering**.
- Works well with **structured or smaller-scale data**.
- Examples: linear regression, decision trees, SVMs.

### Deep Learning
- Uses **neural networks with multiple hidden layers**.
- Learns features **automatically from data**.
- Excels at **high-dimensional and unstructured data** (images, audio, text).
- Requires **large datasets and higher computational power**.
- Examples: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers.

# Core Distinction (Important)
- **Machine Learning** answers:  
    _“Given these features, how do I make a prediction?”_
- **Deep Learning** answers:  
    _“What features should I learn in order to make the prediction?”_

# One-Line Summary

> **Machine Learning depends on features you design.  
   Deep Learning depends on representations the model learns.**
