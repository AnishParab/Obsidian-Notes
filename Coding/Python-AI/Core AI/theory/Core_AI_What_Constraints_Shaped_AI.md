# Core Axes that shaped AI history
All AI progress is constrained by **four variables**:
1. **Representation**  
    How knowledge is encoded (symbols, vectors, parameters)
2. **Learning Mechanism**  
    Rules vs optimization vs statistics
3. **Data Availability**  
    Handcrafted vs observed vs generated
4. **Compute**  
    CPU → GPU → accelerators

Every era is a different configuration of these four.
