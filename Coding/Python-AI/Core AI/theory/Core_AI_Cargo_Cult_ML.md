# The "Cargo Cult" Metaphor
- Melanesia is the historical source of "cargo cults," religious movements that arose during the colonial and World War II eras. These movements involved mimicking the rituals of foreign military forces (such as building wooden airplanes or landing strips) in the belief that these actions would summon the return of material "cargo". While many such movements have faded or evolved into political organizations, they remain a widely used metaphor in fields like machine learning to describe performing rituals without understanding their underlying mechanisms.
