- **Computer Vision**
    - Image classification
    - Object detection
    - Face recognition
    - Medical imaging
- **Speech and Audio**
    - Speech recognition
    - Speaker identification
    - Music and audio synthesis
    - Audio enhancement and denoising
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
    - Machine translation
    - Text summarization
    - Question answering
    - Chatbots and language models
- **Recommendation Systems**
    - Content recommendation

# Performance of Deep Learning
- Deep learning models often achieve **State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance** on many benchmark tasks.
- Performance improves with:
    - Large datasets
    - Deep architectures
    - High computational power (GPUs/TPUs)
- Deep learning systems can **outperform traditional machine learning** when feature extraction is complex or high-dimensional.

# Important Clarification
> Deep learning does **not** guarantee better performance in all cases.

- On small datasets → traditional ML may perform better
- On structured/tabular data → deep learning may be unnecessary
- Performance gains come at the cost of:
    - Higher compute
    - Longer training time
    - Reduced interpretability

---
# When Deep Learning Excels
- Data is **unstructured** (images, audio, text)
- Feature engineering is difficult
- Patterns are hierarchical or abstract
- Scale matters

### One-Line Summary for Notes

> **Deep learning achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving large, complex, and unstructured data by learning representations directly from raw inputs.**
