# Why Machine Learning is not Replacable ?

## Interpretability
- **Machine Learning**
    - Many models are **interpretable** (linear regression, decision trees)
	- Improves interpretability by **Decision Trees**.
- **Deep Learning**
    - Generally **not interpretable**
    - Often described as a **black box**
    - Learned features are abstract and difficult to explain

> Lack of interpretability is a **major limitation** of deep learning, especially in critical domains (healthcare, finance).

# Black Box
- Since Deep Learning behaves like a black box, Machine Learning is **not replacable**.
