# How to verify an onion site is real (3 methods)

### Method 1: “Onion-Location” (best when available)

Some normal websites provide an onion version via a header.  
Tor Browser may show an option like:

- “View Tor Onion Service”

This is strong because the clearnet domain vouches for the onion.

---
### Method 2: compare from multiple trusted sources

Example: the onion address appears identically in:

- official website
- official social account
- reputable docs

---
### Method 3: PGP signed onion address

High-security services publish their onion address signed with PGP.
