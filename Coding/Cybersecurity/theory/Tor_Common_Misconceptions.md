# Remember these
- TOR is not a VPN
	- VPN is 1 hop, while Tor is multi-hop.
- TOR **does not** make you invisible
	- If you log into your real accounts, you identify yourself.
- TOR is not only for illegal stuff, but used for privacy and journalism also.
- TOR does not encrypt everythin end-to-end.
	- The exit node can see plaintext if the site is HTTP (not HTTPS).
