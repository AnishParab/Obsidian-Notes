# Onion Websites Address Format
- It is a very long random-looking string (56 chars) + `.onion`
``` text
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion
```

---
# Note
If you see a very short `.onion`, it may be:
- old v2 address (deprecated)
- fake/scam

✅ Rule: Prefer long addresses.
