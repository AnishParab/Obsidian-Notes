# Git Commit Messages
- **This is Official Website's Opinion**
- Git commit messages should follow **Atomic Commits**.

# Atomic Commit Messages
- Keep commits centric to one feature, one component or one fix **(Focussed on one thing)**.
- Messages should be in **Present tense** and **Imperative**.

> Imperative means give order to codebase, _example: add auth_.
