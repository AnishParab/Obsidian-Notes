# Git vs GitHub
- **Git**: A **distributed version control system** used locally to track changes, manage history, and work with branches and commits.
- **GitHub**: A **cloud-based hosting platform** for Git repositories that enables collaboration, code review, issues, and CI/CD.

**In short**: Git manages code **versions**; GitHub hosts Git repositories and manages **collaboration**.
