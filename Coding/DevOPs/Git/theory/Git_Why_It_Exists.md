# Why Git Exists
### Problem Git Solves
- Multiple developers modifying the same codebase
- Need for **reproducible history**
- Need to **experiment safely** without breaking main code
- Need for **auditability** and **rollback**

### Pre-Git Failure Modes
- Centralized VCS (SVN, CVS):
    - Single point of failure
    - Offline work impossible
    - Merges are fragile and expensive

**Git’s design directly addresses these failure modes.**
