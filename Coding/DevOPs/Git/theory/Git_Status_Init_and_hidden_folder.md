# Git Status
``` bash
git status
```
- `git status` shows the current state of a repository by reporting **modified**, **staged**, **untracked** files and whether the working tree is clean.

---
# Git Init (One time per Project)
``` bash
git init
```
- `git init` initializes a **new Git repository** in a directory by creating the hidden `.git` folder that stores version history and configuration.

---
# `.git` folder
- The **`.git` folder** is the **internal database** of a **Git** repository.  
- It stores **commit history, branches, configuration, and metadata** required for version control.  
- Deleting it removes all Git tracking from the project.
