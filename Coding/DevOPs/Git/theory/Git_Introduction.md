# Git Introduction
**Git** is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)** that records the **complete history of a project** as a **content-addressed directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of commits.

Each clone of a Git repository contains:
- the **entire history**
- the **full commit graph**
- the ability to operate **offline**
