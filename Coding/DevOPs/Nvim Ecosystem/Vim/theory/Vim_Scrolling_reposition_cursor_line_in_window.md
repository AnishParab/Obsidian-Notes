# Reposition Cursor Line in Window

- `zt` → put current cursor line at **top** of window
- `zb` → put current cursor line at **bottom** of window
- `zz` → put current cursor line at **center** of window

More scrolling commands:
```vim
:help Q_sc
```

Keep context lines around cursor:
```vim
:help 'scrolloff'
```

Example **(Good for my eyes personally)**:
```vim
:set scrolloff=20
```
