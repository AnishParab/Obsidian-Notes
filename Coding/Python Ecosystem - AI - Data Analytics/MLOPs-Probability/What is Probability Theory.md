# Probability Theory
**Probability theory** is the mathematics of _uncertainty_.  
It gives us a formal way to describe and reason about events that may or may not happen.

# Core Concepts
- **Sample Space (Ω):**  
    The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.  
    _Example:_ Tossing a coin →  
    $$ \Omega = {Heads, Tails} $$
    
- **Event (E):**  
    A subset of the sample space — something we care about.  
    _Example:_ $$ E = {Heads} $$
    
- **Probability (P):**  
    A function that assigns a number between **0 and 1** to an event, representing its likelihood.  
    $$
    P(E) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}  
    $$  
    _Example:_  
    $$
     P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2} 
   $$

# Intuitive Meaning
Probability theory connects **logic with randomness**.  
Instead of saying “I think it’ll rain,” we quantify uncertainty:

> “There’s a 70% chance of rain.”

This framework scales up from simple coin tosses to:
- Predicting whether a **loan defaults**
- Estimating **pixel classes** in an image
- Inferring **text sentiment**
