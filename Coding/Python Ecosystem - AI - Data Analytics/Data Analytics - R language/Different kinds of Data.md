# Different Kinds of Data

Data can be broadly categorized based on its **structure**, **origin**, and **processing requirements**.

---
## **1. Structured Data**
- Data that is **organized and stored in a fixed format** (rows and columns).
- Easy to **store, access, and analyze** using relational databases (RDBMS).
- Follows a **defined schema**.

### **Examples**
- Tables in SQL databases
- Excel sheets
- Customer records (ID, Name, Age, Email)

---
## **2. Unstructured Data**
- Data that **does not follow a specific format or structure**.
- Difficult to process and analyze using traditional databases.
- Often requires **Big Data tools** or **NoSQL databases** for handling.

### **Examples**
- Text documents
- Images, videos, audio files
- Social media posts, emails, sensor data

---
## **3. Semi-Structured Data**
- Data that **does not follow a strict schema** but still contains **organizational elements** like tags or markers.
- Lies between structured and unstructured data.
- Commonly used in **web and data exchange formats**.

### **Examples**
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- HTML files
- NoSQL database records (e.g., MongoDB documents)
