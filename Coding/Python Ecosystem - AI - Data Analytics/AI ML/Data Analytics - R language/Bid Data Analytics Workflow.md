# Key Insights
- **Cyclical Nature**: Arrows indicate iterative flow, allowing refined data loops (e.g., from applications back to extraction).
- **Hong Kong Focus**: Strong emphasis on local academia (HKUST, CUHK) collaborating with industry (HSBC, Alibaba).
- **Scalability Emphasis**: Workflow supports the "Vs" of big data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity).
- **Trends Today (2025)**: Shift toward AI-augmented analytics, serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda), and federated learning for privacy in health/genetics apps.
