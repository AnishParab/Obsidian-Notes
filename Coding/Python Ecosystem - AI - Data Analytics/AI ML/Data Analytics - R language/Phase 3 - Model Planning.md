# Phase 3 – Model Planning

- **Definition:** Exploring data to understand relationships between variables and selecting the **key variables** and the **most suitable models**.  
- The team also **prepares datasets** for training, testing, and production purposes.  
- Models are **planned and executed** based on insights gained in this phase.  

---
# Key Activities
- **Feature selection:** Identify the most relevant variables for modeling.  
- **Model selection:** Choose the appropriate algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).  
- **Data partitioning:** Split data into training, testing, and validation sets.  
- **Hypothesis refinement:** Refine initial assumptions based on data exploration.

# Traditional Tools
- **MATLAB** – for statistical modeling and simulation  
- **STATISTICA** – for advanced analytics and visualization  
- **SPSS** – for statistical analysis  

---
# Modern Tools
- **Python libraries:** scikit-learn, statsmodels, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **R packages:** caret, randomForest, glmnet  
- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools:** H2O.ai, Google AutoML, DataRobot  
- **Cloud ML platforms:** AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, Google Vertex AI  

> Modern tools allow for **faster experimentation, larger datasets, and more sophisticated modeling**, while traditional tools are often used in **academic or small-scale enterprise settings**.
