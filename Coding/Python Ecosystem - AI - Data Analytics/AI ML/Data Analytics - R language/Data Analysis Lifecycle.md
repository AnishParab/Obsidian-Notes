# Data Analytics Life Cycle

The **Data Analytics Life Cycle** defines best practices for analytics projects, spanning from discovery to project completion. It consists of **six key phases**:

---
## Phase 1 – Discovery
- Understand the **business space**, including its history, stakeholders, innovations, and available data.  
- Goal: Identify objectives and define the problem clearly.

---
## Phase 2 – Data Preparation
- Work with the data and perform **examination and cleaning**.  
- Key tasks:
  - Extract, Load, and Transform (ETL) data.
  - Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors.
  - Prepare datasets for analysis.

---
## Phase 3 – Model Planning
- Define strategies, procedures, and workflows for modeling.  
- Key considerations:
  - Identify **key factors** affecting outcomes.
  - Select the **most appropriate models** for the problem.

---
## Phase 4 – Model Building
- Create datasets for testing, training, and validation.  
- Construct and execute models based on the **planning phase**.  
- Iteratively refine models to improve performance.

---
## Phase 5 – Communicate Results
- Evaluate and interpret the outcomes of the models.  
- Key tasks:
  - Identify **key discoveries**.
  - Assess **business value** of insights.
  - Prepare visualizations and reports for stakeholders.

---
## Phase 6 – Operationalize
- Deliver final reports, briefings, code, and technical artifacts.  
- Key activities:
  - Run a **pilot project** to deploy models in a production environment.
  - Ensure models are **integrated into business processes**.
