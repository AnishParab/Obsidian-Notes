# Analytics Models

Analytics models are used to analyze data and derive insights at different levels of complexity and value. They progress from understanding what happened to predicting and optimizing future outcomes.

## 1. Descriptive Analytics
- **Question answered:** _What happened?_
- **Purpose:** To summarize past data and understand trends or patterns.
- **Output:** Reports, dashboards, and visualizations.
- **Example:** Monthly sales reports, website traffic summaries.

---
## 2. Diagnostic Analytics
- **Question answered:** _Why did it happen?_
- **Purpose:** To determine the **cause** of an event or trend.
- **Output:** Insights into relationships and root causes.
- **Example:** Identifying why sales dropped in a specific region.

---
## 3. Predictive Analytics
- **Question answered:** _What will happen?_
- **Purpose:** To use statistical models and machine learning to **forecast future events**.
- **Output:** Predictions and probabilities.
- **Example:** Predicting customer churn or demand for a product.

---
## 4. Prescriptive Analytics
- **Question answered:** _How can we make it happen?_
- **Purpose:** To recommend **actions or strategies** for optimal outcomes.
- **Output:** Decision options, optimization strategies.
- **Example:** Suggesting best marketing channels to maximize sales.

## **Progression of Analytics**

| **Stage**    | **Focus**             | **Value** | **Difficulty** | **Outcome**              |
| ------------ | --------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Descriptive  | What happened         | Low       | Easy           | Information              |
| Diagnostic   | Why it happened       | Medium    | Moderate       | Hindsight                |
| Predictive   | What will happen      | High      | Complex        | Insight                  |
| Prescriptive | How to make it happen | Very High | Most Complex   | Foresight / Optimization |

### **Key Idea**
As analytics move from **Descriptive → Prescriptive**,
- **Value** and **foresight** increase.
- **Complexity and computational difficulty** also rise.
