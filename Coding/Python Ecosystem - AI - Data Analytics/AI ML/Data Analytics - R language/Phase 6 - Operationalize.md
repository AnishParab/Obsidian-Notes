# Phase 6 – Operationalize

- **Definition:** Deliver the final models, reports, and technical artifacts to integrate analytics into business processes.  
- Teams ensure that models can **run in production environments** and **deliver actionable insights**.  
- Key objectives:
  - Deploy models for real-time or batch use.  
  - Share final **reports, briefings, code, and documentation**.  
  - Run a **pilot project** to validate model performance in a live environment.  

---
# Key Activities
- **Model deployment:** Move models from development to production.  
- **Monitoring:** Track model performance and accuracy over time.  
- **Maintenance:** Update models as new data or requirements arise.  
- **Knowledge transfer:** Train business teams and stakeholders on using insights effectively.

# Traditional Tools
- **Manual reports and dashboards** – periodically delivered to stakeholders  
- **Excel / Access databases** – for small-scale operational data integration  
- **MATLAB / STATISTICA scripts** – batch execution in controlled environments  

---
# Modern Tools
- **Cloud ML platforms:** AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, Google Vertex AI for deployment  
- **Containerization & orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes for scalable production environments  
- **Automated pipelines:** Apache Airflow, Kubeflow for scheduling and monitoring  
- **APIs & integration:** REST/GraphQL APIs to connect models with business applications  
- **Monitoring & analytics dashboards:** Grafana, Tableau, Power BI for ongoing model performance tracking  

> Modern tools enable **robust, scalable, and automated deployment**, while traditional methods are suitable for **smaller, controlled environments** or pilot deployments.
