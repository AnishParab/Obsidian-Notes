# Data Reduction

**Definition:**  
Data reduction is a technique used to obtain a reduced representation of a dataset.  
Its goal is to enable the data mining process to produce the **same or nearly the same results** when applied to the reduced data instead of the original dataset.

## Techniques of Data Reduction

### 1. Dimensionality Reduction
- Reduces the number of **attributes** or **random variables** in the dataset.  
- Common methods include:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Feature Selection
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

---
### 2. Numerosity Reduction
- Replaces the original data with a **smaller alternative representation**.  
- Examples:
  - Sampling
  - Clustering
  - Data aggregation
  - Data compression

---
### 3. Cardinality Reduction
- Applies **transformations** to obtain a reduced representation of the original data.  
- Examples:
  - Discretization
  - Binning
  - Encoding categorical values

---
**Goal:**  
Maintain the essential structure and statistical significance of the data while minimizing storage and computation costs.
