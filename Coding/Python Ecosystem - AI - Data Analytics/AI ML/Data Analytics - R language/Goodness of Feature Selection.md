  1. Train a model using the selected feature subset.  
  2. Evaluate model performance on a **validation dataset**.  
- **Goal:** Choose features that **minimize prediction error** or maximize model accuracy.

# Unsupervised Feature Evaluation
- **Process:**  
  - Examine the input features only (e.g., age, income, savings).
