**Definition:**  
The dimensionality of input refers to the **number of observables or features** used as input in a model (e.g., age, income).

# Effects of Increasing Number of Observables
- **Increased Computation Time**  
   - More features require more calculations during training and inference.
- **Higher Memory Usage**  
   - Storing inputs and intermediate results consumes more memory.
- **Complex Explanations**  
   - Knowledge extracted from the model becomes harder to interpret.
- **Visualization Difficulty**  
   - Simple 2D or 3D visualizations are no longer sufficient.
- **Data Requirement Grows**  
   - More data is needed to adequately cover the feature space.  
   - Leads to the **curse of dimensionality**.

---
**Summary:**  
Adding more observables increases computational, memory, and data requirements while reducing interpretability and visualization clarity.
