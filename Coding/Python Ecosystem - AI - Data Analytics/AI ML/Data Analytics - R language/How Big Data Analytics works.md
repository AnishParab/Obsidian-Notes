# 1. Data Mining
- Helps in **discovering patterns, correlations, and relationships** within large datasets.
- Used to identify **hidden trends** or **anomalies** that may not be visible through simple observation.
- **Example:** Finding associations between customer purchases in a retail store.

---
# 2. Predictive Analytics
- Builds **statistical and machine learning models** to **forecast future events or customer behaviors**.
- Uses **historical data** to predict outcomes like sales, churn rate, or demand.
- **Example:** Predicting which users are likely to cancel subscriptions.

---
# 3. Machine Learning (ML)
- Involves **training algorithms** to learn patterns automatically from large datasets without being explicitly programmed.
- Helps automate **decision-making processes** and improve prediction accuracy over time.
- **Example:** Spam detection, recommendation systems, fraud detection.

---
# 4. Deep Learning (DL)
- A **subset of Machine Learning** that uses **neural networks** with multiple layers to model complex patterns.
- Excels at handling **unstructured data** such as images, audio, and text.
- **Example:** Image recognition, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles.
