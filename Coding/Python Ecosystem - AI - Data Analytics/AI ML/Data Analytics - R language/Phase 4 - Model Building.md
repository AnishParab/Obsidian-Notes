# Phase 4 – Model Building

- **Definition:** Develop datasets for testing, training, and production purposes, and execute the models.  
- The team evaluates whether **existing tools are sufficient** or if a **more robust environment** is needed for model execution.  

---
# Key Activities
- **Dataset preparation:** Finalize training, testing, and validation sets.  
- **Model construction:** Build predictive or descriptive models based on planning.  
- **Model execution:** Run experiments and refine models iteratively.  
- **Tool/environment evaluation:** Decide if current computing resources suffice or if scaling is needed.

# Free / Open-Source Tools
- **R / PL/R** – statistical computing and modeling  
- **Octave** – open-source alternative to MATLAB  
- **WEKA** – machine learning algorithms for data mining

---
# Commercial Tools
- **MATLAB** – high-level numerical computing and modeling  
- **STATISTICA** – advanced analytics, modeling, and visualization  

> Open-source tools are great for **flexible experimentation and cost-saving**, whereas commercial tools provide **robust environments, enterprise support, and advanced analytics features**.
