# Matplotlib
* The foundational Python plotting library.
* Provides complete control over every part of a figure.
* Good for custom, low-level plots (line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc.).
* More verbose, but very flexible.

---
# Seaborn
* Built on top of Matplotlib.
* Provides high-level, visually appealing statistical plots.
* Simplifies complex visualizations (heatmaps, pairplots, distribution plots).
* Better default styles and easier for quick exploratory analysis.

# Installing
``` bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn
