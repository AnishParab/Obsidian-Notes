# Gambler’s Fallacy

### **Definition**
The **Gambler’s Fallacy** is the mistaken belief that **past independent events affect future outcomes** in random processes.

In other words:

> “If something hasn’t happened for a while, it’s _due_ to happen soon.”

---
### **Classic Example**
- You flip a fair coin and get **Heads five times in a row**.
- The fallacy is thinking that the next flip is _more likely_ to be Tails.

**Reality:**
- Each coin flip is independent.
- Probability of Tails on the next flip is still **0.5**, no matter what happened before.

---
### **Why It Happens**

Humans naturally look for patterns and assume "balance" in randomness.

- We expect outcomes to _even out quickly_ (“law of averages”), but LLN only applies over **many trials**, not the next single event.

---
### **Other Examples**
1. Roulette: “Red hasn’t come up in 10 spins, so Black is more likely.” ❌
2. Dice: “I rolled 6 three times, so next roll probably isn’t 6.” ❌

**Fact:** Every roll or spin is independent — history doesn’t influence the outcome.

---
### **Key Takeaway**
Random events don’t have memory.  
Understanding independence is crucial in probability and machine learning:
- Training batches, sampling, and Monte Carlo simulations all rely on independence assumptions.
