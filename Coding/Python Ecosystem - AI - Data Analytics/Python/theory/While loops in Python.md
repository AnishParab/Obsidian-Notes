# Problem
You want to simulate tea heating. It starts at 40 C and boils at 100 C.
- Use a while loop.
- Increase temperature by 15 until it reaches or exceeds 100.
- Print each temperature step.

---
# Code
``` python
temperature = 40

while temperature < 100:
	print(f"Current temperature: {temperature}")
	temperature += 15
	
print("Tea is ready to be served")
```
