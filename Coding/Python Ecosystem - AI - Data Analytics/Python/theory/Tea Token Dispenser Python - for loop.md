# Project
 A tea stall owner has a digital token display. For every customer in line, a token number is printed and chai is served.
 - Use a `for` loop to generate token numbers from 1 to 10 using `range()`
 - Print: "Serving chai to Token `#[number]`"
---
# Code
``` python
for token in range(1, 11):
	print(f"Serving chai to Token #{token}")
```

- `range(1, 11)` -> Here 11 is not inclusive.
