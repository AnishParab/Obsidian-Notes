# Strings in Python **(Immutable)**
- Strings are **immutable** (cannot be changed after creation).
- Defined using single (`'`), double (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` / `"""`).

---
# Creating a String

```python
chai_type = "Ginger chai"
```

---
# Indexing
- Indexing starts at **0**.
- Each character has a unique position.

| Character | Index |
| --------- | ----- |
| G         | 0     |
| i         | 1     |
| n         | 2     |
| g         | 3     |
| e         | 4     |
| r         | 5     |
|           | 6     |
| c         | 7     |
| h         | 8     |
| a         | 9     |
| i         | 10    |

### Access by Index

```python
print(chai_type[0])  # Output: G
print(chai_type[-1]) # Output: i
```

`-1` refers to the **last character**.
