# What is REST?
- **REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an **architectural style** for designing networked applications.

---
# Key Principles of RESTful APIs
- All communication happens over **HTTP protocol**.
- **Statelessness**:  
  - The server does not store any client-related session information.  
  - Ensures scalability since each request is independent.  
- **Client-Server Architecture**:  
  - Separation of concerns between client (UI/UX) and server (data/logic).  
- **Uniform Interface**:  
  - Consistent and standardized way to interact with resources.  
- **Cacheable Responses**:  
  - Responses should define whether they are cacheable to improve performance.

# Why Use REST APIs?
- **Interoperability**: Works across different platforms and technologies.  
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally due to stateless nature.  
- **Flexibility**: Decouples client and server, allowing independent development and evolution.
