# Objects
- Objects store **unordered key-value pairs**. They are used to represent structured data, mappings, and entities.

##### Syntax
``` js
const obj = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  // ...
};
```
- Keys (a.k.a. properties) are always strings or symbols.
- Values can be **any type**: string, number, array, function, even another object.

# Example
``` js
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isAdmin: true
};
```
