# Worst Case Scenario **(Preferred)**
**Asymptotic Notation:**
$$
[
O(f(n))
]
$$

Describes the **upper bound** on running time — the algorithm will never be slower than this bound.

> **NOTE**: This is mostly used to optimize your code.

# Best Case Scenario
**Asymptotic Notation:**
$$
[
\Omega(f(n))
]
$$

Represents the **lower bound** — the algorithm will never be faster than this bound.

---
# Average Case Scenario
**Asymptotic Notation:**
$$
[
\Theta(f(n))
]
$$

Represents the **tight bound** — captures typical performance when inputs are randomly distributed.

---
# **Summary Condition**
$$
[  
\Theta = O\ \text{+}\ \Omega\ \text{(both must hold)}  
]
$$
- Big O → **upper bound**
- Omega → **lower bound**
- Together → **tight bound**
