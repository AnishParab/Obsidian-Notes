# Steps to Construct an Algorithm

## **1. Define the Problem Clearly**
Identify:
* Goal
* Inputs and outputs
* Constraints
* Edge cases
* Required test scenarios (end-to-end)

---
## **2. Choose or Design an Approach**
Select the strategy that best fits the problem:
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Method
* Backtracking
* Brute Force (baseline)
* Other problem-specific techniques

---
## **3. Represent the Logic**
- Use a **flowchart**, **pseudocode**, or structured steps to model the algorithm before coding.

---
## **4. Test the Logic**
Validate the algorithm with:
* Normal test cases
* Edge cases
* Stress cases
* Negative cases
Ensure correctness before implementation.

---
### **5. Implement the Algorithm**
- Translate the design into a programming language such as Python.

---
### **6. Analyze Performance**
Evaluate:
* **Time complexity** (efficiency of operations)
* **Space complexity** (memory usage)
* Potential trade-offs
