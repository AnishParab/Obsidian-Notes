# Static Arrays

- Size must be defined **in advance**.
- Example: `n = 9`
- Common in languages like **C / C++**.

> Gives an **exception / out-of-bounds error** if you access an index beyond the array size.

---
# Dynamic Arrays

- No need to define array size **in advance**.
- Supported in languages like **Python** (via dynamic arrays under the hood).

> When more capacity is needed, a new larger array is allocated (typically ~2× capacity) and previous elements are copied.
