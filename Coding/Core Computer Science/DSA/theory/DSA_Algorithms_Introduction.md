# Essential Properties of an Algorithm

### **1. Finiteness**
- The algorithm must **terminate** after a limited number of steps.

### **2. Output**
- It must produce **at least one well-defined result**.

### **3. Definiteness**
- Each step must be **clear, precise, and unambiguous**.
- No vague operations.

### **4. Input (optional but usual)**
- An algorithm may take **zero or more inputs**.

### **5. Effectiveness**
- Each operation must be **basic enough** to execute in a real-world computing model.

### **6. Language Independence**
- An algorithm describes logic, **not code**.
- It is independent of any specific programming language.
