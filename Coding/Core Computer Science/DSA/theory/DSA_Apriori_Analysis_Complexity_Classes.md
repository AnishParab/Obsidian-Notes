> **NOTE** : As we move down, we are incrementing the complexity.

---
# Constant complexity
- **O(1)**

---
# Logarithmic complexity
- **O($log (n)$)

---
# Linear complexity
- **O(n)**

---
# Quadratic complexity
- **O($n^2$)**

---
# Cubic complexity
- **O($n^3$)

---
# Polynomial complexity
- **O($n^c$)**
- $c > 0$

---
# Exponential complexity
- **O($c^n$)
- $c > 1$

---
# Important Relationship
- **$2^n < n! < n^n$**

---
# Reverse when $log(n)$ comes to power
**Example**
- $log(n) < n$
- $(log(n))^2 < n^2$
- $(log(n))^3 < n^3$

**But when we take $log(n)$ in power**
- $(\log n)^{\log n} > n^{\log n}$
- This is done by multiplying $logn$ on both sides.

---
# $2^n$ and $3^n$
- $2^n < 3^n$

---
# $\log_{2} n$ and $\log_{3} n$
- $\log_{2} n$ > $\log_{3} n$
- **Lower base** -> **Higher complexity**
