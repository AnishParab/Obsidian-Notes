# Why React Is Not an Ecosystem by Itself

## Core Reason

- React is **UI-only**
- No built-in solutions beyond rendering

---
## What You Must Add

- **Routing**
    - `react-router-dom`
    - `TanStack Router`
- **State**
    - Local: `useState`, `useReducer`
    - Global: `Zustand`, `Redux Toolkit`
- **Server State**
    - `TanStack Query`
- **Styling / Motion**
    - `Tailwind CSS`
    - `Framer Motion`

---
## Summary

- React = rendering layer
- Full app = React + chosen libraries
- Ecosystem is **curated**, not bundled
