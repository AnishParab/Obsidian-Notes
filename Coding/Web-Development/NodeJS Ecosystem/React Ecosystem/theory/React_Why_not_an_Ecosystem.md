# The "Modular Stack" (Standard Ecosystem)

Because React is "UI-only," building a full-scale application requires a curated ecosystem:

- **Routing:** `react-router-dom` (Standard) or `TanStack Router` (Type-safe).
- **State Management:** 
	- _Local:_ `useState` / `useReducer`.
    - _Global:_ `Zustand` (Lightweight) or `Redux Toolkit` (Enterprise).
- **Server State:** `TanStack Query` (Handles caching, loading states, and revalidation).
- **Styling:** `Tailwind CSS` (Utility-first) or `Framer Motion` (Animations).
