# Architectural Philosophy: Library vs Framework

- React = **library**
- Follows **Unix philosophy**: one concern, composable

---
# Library vs Framework

- **Library**: you control flow
- **Framework**: framework controls flow (IoC)

# Comparison

| Aspect       | React            | Next.js / Angular |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Control flow | Developer-driven | Framework-driven  |
| Opinionation | Low              | High              |
| Architecture | Flexible         | Prescribed        |
| Tooling      | Opt-in           | Built-in          |

# Notes

- React handles only UI
- Frameworks trade flexibility for convention
