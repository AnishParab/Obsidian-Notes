# npm / Yarn Classic: Pain Points

1. **Duplication**
    - Each project stores its own packages
    - Large disk usage
	
2. **Phantom Dependencies**
    - Hoisting flattens tree
    - Undeclared imports work accidentally
	
3. **Slow Installs**
    - File copying is expensive
    - Scales poorly with project size
