# Why React?

- Declarative UI
- Describe **what** the UI should be, not **how** to update it

---
## Performance (Virtual DOM)

- Avoids frequent direct DOM mutations
- **Batching**: group state updates
- **Diffing**: update only changed nodes

---
## Portability

- Same mental model across platforms
    - Web: `react-dom`
    - Mobile: React Native
    - Desktop: Electron

---
## Ecosystem

- Unopinionated, modular
- Routing, state, data fetching are opt-in
- Easy to replace parts without rewrites

---
## Stability

- Mature ecosystem
- Backed by Meta
- Long-term API stability
