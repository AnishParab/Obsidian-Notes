# Why React?

> [!success] Core Value
> 
> React shifts focus from **how** to update the UI (imperative) to **what** the UI should look like based on data (declarative).

# Performance: The Virtual DOM

React avoids expensive browser DOM operations by using a "Virtual" copy.

- **Batching**: Groups updates to prevent UI flicker.
- **Diffing**: Only updates specific elements that changed.

---
# Portability & Ecosystem

- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Same logic works for Web (`react-dom`), Mobile (`React Native`), and Desktop (`Electron`).
- **Modular**: Plug-and-play libraries for routing and state (unlike "all-in-one" frameworks).
- **Stability**: Industry standard with long-term support from Meta.
