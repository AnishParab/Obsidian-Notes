| Issue              | Description                                                                   |

| ❌ Not Modular      | Arbitrary values can lead to **repetition** and are not reusable.             |
| ❌ Hard to Maintain | If you change the brand color, you must update it **everywhere** manually.    |
| ❌ Lacks Semantics  | `text-[#973F29]` doesn't describe **why** the color is used (e.g. "primary"). |
