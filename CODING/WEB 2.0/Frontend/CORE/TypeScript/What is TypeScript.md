# What is TypeScript?
**TypeScript** is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds **static typing**, advanced tooling, and modern language features to improve code **quality**, **maintainability**, and **developer experience**.

# Key Features
- **Superset of JavaScript**  
    ➤ All valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript.
- **Static Typing**  
    ➤ Detects type errors at compile time instead of runtime.
- **Type Definitions**  
    ➤ Explicit or inferred types for variables, functions, objects, and classes.
- **Improved Code Quality**  
    ➤ Type checks, autocomplete, and better IDE support lead to cleaner code.
- **Better Maintainability**  
    ➤ Self-documenting code with interfaces and types makes collaboration easier.
- **Advanced Language Features**
    - `interface` – Defines object contracts
    - `type` – Alias for unions, primitives, functions
    - `generics` – Build reusable type-safe components
    - `decorators` – Meta-programming capabilities (experimental)
    - `namespaces` – Logical code grouping (legacy)
    - `type inference` – Auto-detects types when not declared
- **Fewer Runtime Errors**  
    ➤ Many bugs are caught at compile time, especially in large codebases.
