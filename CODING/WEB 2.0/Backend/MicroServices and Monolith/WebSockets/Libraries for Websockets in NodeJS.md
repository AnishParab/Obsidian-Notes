# Websocket Libraries
1. [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket) ---> Pure Web-Socket Implementation.

2. [github](https://github.com/websockets/ws) ---> Pure Web-Socket Implementation. **Really good for fine-grained applications. Hence Refer this for code**.

3. [socketio](https://socket.io/) ---> Beginner Friendly but Harder to support Multiple Platforms and Servers. There are separate clients for Rust, C++, Java etc.
