# What is a Linked List?
- Linear Data Structure
- It consists of a collection of **nodes**.

---
# What is a Node?
- **Node = node_data + address_of_next_node**

---
# Why use Linked List?
- You can change the **size** at runtime using linked list.

---
# Theory
- Linked List is a type of dynamic data structure.
- Which means its size can grow and shrink at runtime.
- This implies, no memory wastage.

- Insertion and deletion is easy in linked list.
- Unlike arrays and vectors no shifting of elements is required to do such thing.

---
**NOTE :- It uses Heap memory**.
