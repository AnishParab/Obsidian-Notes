``` cpp
int width ( 5 ); // direct initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

---
- Direct-initialization had fallen out of favor in modern C++, largely due to being superseded by direct-list-initialization.

# **NOTE**
Direct-initialization is also used when values are explicitly cast to another type (e.g. via `static_cast`).
