# Compiler
- Gives Syntax Errors.
- Translates code to machine language instructions.
- These instructions are stored in an intermediate file called an _object file_ (`name.o` or `name.obj`).

---
# Linker
- Combine all object files.
- Firstly, it reads in each of the object files generated by the compiler.
- Secondly, it ensures all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly.
- Lastly, it outputs an executable file.

---
# Libraries
- **C++ Standard Library**.
- Third Party Libraries.

---
# Building
- This whole process is called as **building**.
- The result is called as **build**.
