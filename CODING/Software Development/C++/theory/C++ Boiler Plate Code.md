``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}
```

---
# pre-processor directive
- This `#include` pre-processor directive indicates that we would like to use the contents of the `iostream` library, which is the part of the C++ standard library that allows us to read and write text from/to the console.
- We need this line in order to use `std::cout`.

---
# `cout`
- Stands for character output.
- `<<` is an operator.

---
# `return 0`
When an executable program finishes running, the program sends a value back to the operating system in order to indicate whether it ran successfully or not. This particular return statement returns the integer value `0` to the operating system, which means “everything went okay!”. This is the last statement in the program that executes.
