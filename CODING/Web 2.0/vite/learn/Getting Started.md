# What is vite?
- Vite is a fast dev server and build tool that leverages native ES modules and modern bundlers like Rollup + esbuild.

---
# Why to use?
- Fast Startup.
- Zero Config Setup.
- Optimized production builds.

---
# Hot Module Replacement
- Updates are **incremental** and **targeted**.
- Only the changed module is reloaded â€” no full reload or slow rebuilds.
-  **Benefit:** Live code changes in milliseconds, even in large projects.

This is very time consuming and makes hot reloading very slow.
