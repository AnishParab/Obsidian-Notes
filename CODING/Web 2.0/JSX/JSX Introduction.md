# What is JSX
- JavaScript XML.
- Syntax extension for JavaScript.
- Let's you write HTML like syntax.
- Makes writing React code Easy.
- It is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like `<br />`
- Your component also canâ€™t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a `<div>...</div>` or an empty `<>...</>` wrapper:

- **It's a syntactic sugar for `React.createElement()` calls, compiled by babel.**
