#  `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Declares the **document type**.
- Tells the browser that the file is an **HTML5** document.
- Ensures consistent rendering across browsers (standards mode).

---
#  `<html>`
- The **root element** of any HTML document.
- Wraps the entire HTML structure (everything inside the page).

---
#  `<head>`
- Contains **meta-information** about the page — not directly visible to the user.
- Typical contents include:
  - `<meta>` tags (charset, viewport, SEO data)
  - `<title>` – sets the tab title
  - `<link>` – to external stylesheets (like CSS)
  - `<script>` – to load JS (often deferred)

##### This section helps with:
- **SEO** (Search Engine Optimization)
- **Browser rendering behavior**
- **External resource linking**

---
# `<body>`
- Contains the **visible content** of the webpage.
- Everything users see and interact with goes here:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Buttons
  - Forms
  - JavaScript-driven features

 Think of it as the **canvas** for the user interface.
