#  Web Development
Web Development involves creating websites and web applications that are accessible via the internet.

---
##  Website
- **Static**  
  Simple, fixed-content pages. Content does not change unless edited manually (e.g., HTML/CSS only).

---
##  Web Application
- **Dynamic**  
  Interactive, data-driven systems where content changes based on user interaction or server-side logic (e.g., using JavaScript, APIs, databases).

---
##  Frontend
- **User Interface (UI)**  
  The visual part of the website or application that users interact with. Technologies:  
  - HTML (structure)  
  - CSS (styling)  
  - JavaScript (interactivity)

---
##  Backend
- **Logic & Functionality**  
  The behind-the-scenes code that powers the app. It handles:  
  - Server-side operations  
  - Business logic  
  - API interactions  
  - Security & authentication

---
##  Database
- **Storing Data**  
  Stores and manages data used by the backend and displayed on the frontend. Examples:  
  - MySQL  
  - PostgreSQL  
  - MongoDB
