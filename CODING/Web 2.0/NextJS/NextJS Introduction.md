# What is NextJS?
- It is a **React Framework**.
- **React** is not feasible to create a fully-featured application ready for application.
- You need to make decisions about other features such as routing, data fetching and more.
- You don't need to install additional packages as **Next.js** provides everything you need.
- However, opinions and conventions must be followed to implement these features.

# Why learn Next.js?
- **Routing** ---> This is allowed by using _file-based routing_.
- **API Routes** ---> Both _frontend react components_ and _backend api's_ can be built in the same Next.js application allowing seamless integration of your frontend and backend code.
- **Rendering** ---> It allows both _Server-Side_ and _Client-Side_ rendering approaches. This leads to improves performance and better Search Engine Optimization.
- **Streamlined Data Fetching** ---> It provides built-in _async-await_ support in React components.
- **Flexible Styling** ---> Supports CSS modules.
- **Optimization** ---> Out of the box optimization for scripts, images and fonts.
- **Optimized Dev and Prod build systems** ---> Deals with prod build system.
