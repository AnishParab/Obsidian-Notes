# RSC
- This architecture introduces a new approach to creating React components by dividing them into two distinct types.

1. **Server Components**
2. **Client Components**

---
# **NOTE** (Server Components)
> NextJS treats all components as **Server Components** by default.

- The trade-off is that they can't use React hooks or handle user interactions.

---
# Client Component
- To create a client component, add a `use client` directive at the top of your component file.
