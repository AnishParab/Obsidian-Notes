### 1. **Fast Development Builds**
- Activated via `next dev --turbo`, Turbopack is now **stable for development** with Next.js 15
- Performance gains include:
    - Startup times up to **76% faster**.
    - Hot reloads (Fast Refresh) up to **96% quicker**.
    - Route load times significantly reduced, even without caching

---
### 2. **Incremental and Cached Architecture**

- Designed around Rust’s Turbo framework for function-level memoization—only re-bundles code that changed.
- In Next.js 15.2, improvements brought ~30% lower memory use, faster compiles, and strides toward persistent on-disk caching.

---
### 3. **Webpack Compatibility & Configuration**

- Provides limited compatibility with Webpack loader APIs (e.g., `babel-loader`, `file-loader`, `@svgr/webpack`).
- Built-in support for CSS, React, and TypeScript—no extra loader config usually needed [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- Supports customization via `turbopack` key in `next.config.js` for loader rules, aliasing, and extensions.

---
### 4. **Opt-In Production Builds (Alpha)**

- Next.js 15.3 adds experimental production `next build --turbopack`.
    - If `dev --turbo` works, `build --turbopack` likely will too—though still alpha, so suited for staging/testing.
- Currently not recommended for mission-critical production without further alpha validation.
