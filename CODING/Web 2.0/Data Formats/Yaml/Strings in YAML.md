1. Strings can be written as **plain text**, **single-quoted**, or **double-quoted**.
2. Special characters must be quoted.

``` YAML
plain_string: Hello, YAML
quoted_string: "This is a string with special characters: \n"
single_quoted: 'It''s a single-quoted string'
double_quoted: "Double-quoted allows escape sequences: \t Tab"
```

Escape sequences can be used such as `\n` and `\t`.
