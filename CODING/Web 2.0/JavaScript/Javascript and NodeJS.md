# JavaScript

- **Client-Side Language**  
  Runs in the browser to make web pages interactive.

- **High-Level Language**  
  Abstracts away most hardware details.

- **Interpreted Language**  
  Code is executed line-by-line without prior compilation.

- **Dynamically Typed**  
  No need to declare variable types explicitly.

- **Multi-Paradigm Language**  
  Supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional, and Procedural programming styles.

- **First-Class Functions**  
  Functions are treated like variables â€” can be assigned, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

- **Asynchronous Programming**  
  Allows non-blocking operations, e.g., callbacks, promises, async/await.

- **Event-Driven**  
  Executes code in response to events like user actions, network responses, etc.

# Node.js

- **Server-Side Runtime Environment**  
  Allows running JavaScript outside the browser.

- **Built on C++ and V8 Engine**  
  Combines Google's V8 JavaScript engine with C++ for performance.

- **Extends JavaScript with Additional Features**  
  Provides modules for file system access, networking, and more beyond vanilla JS.

- **Enables Building Scalable Network Applications**  
  Ideal for real-time applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
