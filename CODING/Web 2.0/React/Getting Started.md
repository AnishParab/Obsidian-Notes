# Why use React?
#### **UI Library, not a Framework**
Lightweight and focused on the view layer only. (V in MVC)

#### **Single Page Application (SPA) Support**
Dynamic content update without full page reload.

#### **Component Based Architecture**
Modular, reusable, and maintainable UI pieces.

#### **Virtual DOM**
Efficient updates by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.

#### **Developer Friendly**
Easier to debug, understand and reason about.

#### **State Management**
Built-in mechanisms and easy integration with Redux or Zustand.
