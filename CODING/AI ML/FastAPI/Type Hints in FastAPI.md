# FastAPI uses the same declarations to:
#### Define requirements
From request path parameters, query parameters, headers, bodies, dependencies, etc.

#### Convert Data
From the request to the required type.

#### Validate data
Generating **automatic errors** returned to the client when the data is invalid.

#### **Document** the API using OpenAPI
Which is then used by the automatic interactive documentation user interfaces.
