- List ---> Mutable
- Tuple ---> Immutable

---
``` python
tea_types = ("Black", "Green", "Oolong")

print(tea_types)
print(tea_types[0])

# Show index
tea_types.count("Black")

# Assign variables to each tuple value
(black, green, Oolong) = tea_types
# Hence this gives "Black" assigned to black
```

---
# Nested
``` python
("", (1,2,3), "")
```
