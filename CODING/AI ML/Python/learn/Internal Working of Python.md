- Script ---> Compiled ---> Byte Code(Hidden) ---> Python Virtual Machine

---
# Byte Code
- Low level and Platform Independent
- It runs faster.
- Machine Independent.

- It is not machine code.
- It is a python specific interpretation.

---
# `.pyc`
- This is compiled python ---> _frozen binaries_.
- Maintains _source change_ and _python version_.

---
# `__pycache__`
- Works only for imported files.
- Not for top level files.

---
# Python Virtual Machine
- Code loop to iterate byte code.
- Run Time Engine.
- Also known as _Python Interpreter_.

- cpython, jpython, Iron Python, Stackless, PyPy.
- __cpython__ is the standard implementation.
