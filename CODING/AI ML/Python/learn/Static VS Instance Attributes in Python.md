# Instance Attributes
- Variables that are declared in the `__init__` method (or any instance method)
- Attached to individual objects via `self.attribute`.
- Unique per object. One object does not effect the other.

# Static vs Instance Attributes
**Static attributes** are shared across all instances of a class, while **instance attributes** are unique to each object.
