# What is Spaced Repetition
- **Spaced repetition** is a scientifically proven learning technique that helps you **remember information for the long term** by reviewing it at **increasing intervals** based on how well you know it.

# Working of Spaced Repetition Technique
When you learn a new word or fact:
- You review it **soon after first learning it**
- If you remember it correctly, the next review happens **later**
- If you forget it, the interval **shrinks**, and it's shown again **sooner**

This way, your brain is challenged _just before_ it forgets â€” which is the **optimal time for memory retention**.

# The Spacing Effect (Memory Curve)
Psychologist **Hermann Ebbinghaus** discovered the **forgetting curve**:

> We forget information quickly unless we review it.

**Spaced repetition "resets" the forgetting curve** each time you review and recall something correctly.

# Pseudo-Code
1. Apply the optimization procedures to the smallest possible items.
2. Differentiate between the items on the base of their different difficulty.
